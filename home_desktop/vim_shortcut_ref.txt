	Ctrl-t to toggle

CtrlP
	Basic Usage
	Run :CtrlP or :CtrlP [starting-directory] to invoke CtrlP in find file mode.
	Run :CtrlPBuffer or :CtrlPMRU to invoke CtrlP in find buffer or find MRU file mode.
	Run :CtrlPMixed to search in Files, Buffers and MRU files at the same time.
	Check :help ctrlp-commands and :help ctrlp-extensions for other commands.

	Once CtrlP is open:
	Press <F5> to purge the cache for the current directory to get new files, remove deleted files and apply new ignore options.
	Press <c-f> and <c-b> to cycle between modes.
	Press <c-d> to switch to filename only search instead of full path.
	Press <c-r> to switch to regexp mode.
	Use <c-j>, <c-k> or the arrow keys to navigate the result list.
	Use <c-t> or <c-v>, <c-x> to open the selected entry in a new tab or in a new split.
	Use <c-n>, <c-p> to select the next/previous string in the prompt's history.
	Use <c-y> to create a new file and its parent directories.
	Use <c-z> to mark/unmark multiple files and <c-o> to open them.
	Run :help ctrlp-mappings or submit ? in CtrlP for more mapping help.

	Submit two or more dots .. to go up the directory tree by one or multiple levels.
	End the input string with a colon : followed by a command to execute it on the opening file(s):
	Use :25 to jump to line 25.
	Use :diffthis when opening multiple files to run :diffthis on the first 4 files.

SimplyFold
	
	Use Vim's built-in folding commands to expand and collapse folds.
	The most basic commands are zc to close a fold and zo to open one.
	See :help fold-commands for full documentation.

Special keys: Tab, Backspace, Enter, Esc

    Text Terminals send characters (bytes), not key strokes.
    Special keys such as Tab, Backspace, Enter and Esc are encoded as control characters.
    Control characters are not printable, they display in the terminal as ^ and are intended to have an effect on applications.

    Ctrl+I = Tab
    Ctrl+J = Newline
    Ctrl+M = Enter
    Ctrl+[ = Escape

    Many terminals will also send control characters for keys in the digit row:
    Ctrl+2 → ^@
    Ctrl+3 → ^[ Escape
    Ctrl+4 → ^\
    Ctrl+5 → ^]
    Ctrl+6 → ^^
    Ctrl+7 → ^_ Undo
    Ctrl+8 → ^? Backward-delete-char

    Ctrl+v tells the terminal to not interpret the following character, so Ctrl+v Ctrl-I will display a tab character,
    similarly Ctrl+v ENTER will display the escape sequence for the Enter key: ^M

History:

  Ctrl + r   Recall the last command including the specified character(s)
             searches the command history as you type.

  Ctrl + p   Previous command in history (i.e. walk back through the command history)
  Ctrl + n   Next command in history (i.e. walk forward through the command history)

  Ctrl + s   Go back to the next most recent command.
             (beware to not execute it from a terminal because this will also launch its XOFF).
  Ctrl + o   Execute the command found via Ctrl+r or Ctrl+s
  Ctrl + g   Escape from history searching mode
        !!   Repeat last command
      !n     Repeat from the last command: args n e.g. !:2 for the second argumant.
      !n:m   Repeat from the last command: args from n to m. e.g. !:2-3 for the second and third.
